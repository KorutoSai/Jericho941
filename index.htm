                            style="width:400px;height:280px;margin-left:15px;">The
                        Jericho 941 is a double-action/single-action
                        semi-automatic pistol developed by Israel Military
                        Industries (1933–2005) now <a href="https://iwi.net/iwi-jericho-pistol/" target="_blank">Israel Weapon Industries</a>
                        (2005–present) introduced in 1990.</p>
                    <p>The original Jericho 941 was modeled on the CZ-75 pistol
                        and built using parts supplied by the Italian arms house
                        Tanfoglio, which had been making their own CZ-75 clones.</p>
                    <p>Using a well-tested design allowed IMI to avoid the
                        teething problems most new pistol designs experience,
                        and subcontracting much of the basic fabrication work to
                        Tanfoglio allowed IMI to quickly put into production a
                        pistol that would have enough Israeli content to satisfy
                        government contract requirements</p>
                    <p>While the R-versions of the Jericho 941 feature a
                        combined safety/decocker (the decocking lever also acts
                        as a safety and remains on "safe" when actuated), the
                        decocker version of the CZ-75 (CZ-75BD) features a
                        simple decocker (the pistol is always ready to fire in
                        double-action mode when decocked).</p>
                    <p>The barrel of the CZ-75 is traditionally rifled, while
                        the Jericho 941 features a polygonal barrel, furthermore
                        the Jericho 941 is substantially heavier. These
                        differences translate into substantial differences in
                        the condition in which the gun is carried. Magazines for
                        the CZ-75 and Tanfoglio T95 will function in the Jericho
                        941.</p>
                    <p>One innovation by IMI was a new, much "hotter" cartridge,
                        the .41 Action Express (see below) to go along with the
                        Jericho 941. A key feature shared between 9mm and .41 AE
                        is that the Action Express cartridges have rebated-rims,
                        which are the same diameter as the less powerful rounds,
                        but the case is wider, providing more capacity and
                        potential for more power. This allows these pairs of
                        calibers to be used in the same firearm with only a
                        change of the barrel, recoil spring, and magazine.</p>
                    <p>The .41 AE was less commercially successful than the 10mm
                        Auto, and was soon discontinued. Experience
                        with heavily loaded rounds gave IMI a considerable lead,
                        however, in chambering for the soon-to-be successful .40
                        S&W and also allowed the Jericho to be designed for the
                        popular .45 ACP. The Jericho 941 design has been
                        modified to include accessory rails on the frame for
                        mounting lasers or flashlights, a feature found on many
                        modern semi-automatic handguns.</p>

                    <header>Variants</header>
                    <p>The introduction of the Jericho 941 also introduced a new
                        caliber to the market, the .41 Action Express (or .41
                        AE), which was developed in 1986. The .41 AE was a
                        rebated rim cartridge designed to use .410-inch (10.25
                        mm) bullets and duplicate a reduced power police loading
                        of the .41 Magnum. The Jericho originally shipped
                        with two barrels, one for 9×19mm Parabellum and the
                        other for .41 AE. Since the .41 AE was designed with a
                        rebated rim the same dimensions as that of the 9 mm, the
                        extractor and ejector worked equally well for either
                        cartridge. </p>

                    <p>A later compact version, the Jericho 941, was chambered
                        in .45 ACP or 9 mm.</p>
                    <p>Initially Jericho pistols used barrels with polygonal
                        rifling, which sometimes produces slightly higher
                        velocity due to better bullet to barrel fit. IWI
                        switched to conventional land and groove rifling from
                        2005 to 2007.</p>
                    <p>The Jericho 941 is issued in current service throughout
                        the Israeli Security Forces and several foreign security
                        Services.</p>

                        anime, Cowboy Bebop predominately featured the Jericho
                        941 R model as Spike's, the main protagonist, weapon of
                        choice.</p>

                    <p>Spike Spiegel's signature pistol is a customized IMI
                        Jericho 941 R chambered in 9x19mm. He has installed
                        custom grips and a frame mounted laser sight on the
                        right side, although we never see him use it.</p>
                    <p>The original Jericho 941 came with two barrels for use
                        with either 9mm or .41AE ammunition. A blued steel rod
                        was intended for the 9mm round with a lighter spring,
                        and a stainless steel rod with heavier springs for the
                        larger load of the .41AE round. Spike's Jericho is
                        chambered in 9mm but features a silver recoil spring. We
                        can assume this was either due to artistic license, or
                        part of the modifications Spike made to the gun. Worth
                        noting that many actual owners of a Jericho 941
                        chambered in 9mm change the stock rod/recoil spring with
                        an aftermarket chrome kit based on the .41 AE version,
                        to reduce recoil and increase rate of fire.</p>
